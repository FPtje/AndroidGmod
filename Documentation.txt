DEVELOPERS:

It's very easy to make scripts that hook onto the Android device.
The angles are often not in the best format for your particular use. Some manipulation might be required. See the examples.

There are three hooks that can be used:

Hook: AndroidOrientation
Description: When the orientation of the Android device changes, this hook is called.
Parameters:
	- Angle ang: the current angle of the Android device

Hook: AndroidAcceleration
Description: When the phone moves, this hook is called.
Parameters:
	- Vector vec: the measured movement in the given direction.
		Note: the speed can be measured with vec:Length()

Hook: AndroidButton
Description: When one of the six buttons on the Android device are pressed or released
Parameters:
	- int ButtonNr: The number of the button (from 1 to 6)
	- bool pressed: true on press, false on release
